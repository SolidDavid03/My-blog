    <p>
    I'm a 21 years old aspiring full stack developer. I'm italian and I'm passionate about learning, languages, tech and more.
    <br>
    In my free time I dedicate myself to self-improvement: I do meditation, journaling, I train at the gym or at home, study and love reading. Discipline and perseverance are my inspirational muses. I am very passionate about the English language both colloquially and technically.
    <br>
    My philosophy of life is to live for what you believe in regardless of if you're right or wrong cause I think that's a relative concept. I believe in the fact that everyone is special in somehow, but it's up to the individual to see or not their potential and for what purposes to use it.
    If we were to summarize my way of facing life it would be with the phrase "Live as if you were to die tomorrow and learn as if you were to live forever".
