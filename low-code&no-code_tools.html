    After a one year experience in a company which its culture is based on the use of low-code/ no-code tools I think I am qualified enough to be able to express my opinion on this category of tools.
    While I have been working in this company which by the way was my first experience in the job market, I mainly used Google AppSheet and FlowiseAI although I also used WixStudio for little while.

    I think the main problem is that since you don’t write code to develop something, you have limits on the customization you can apply because you can’t do the same things you would do using code. This is a problem especially when
    the customer makes some request that goes beyond the capabilities of the tool and they do not want to compromise. So you find yourself in situations where you stress yourself more than you should, but if this happens it means that
    there was something that did not work out during the negotiation. It is right that you have to sell solutions because otherwise you can't earn for a living, but in my opinion it would be good and right to put things straight and make the potential customer understand,
    not only the solution you are selling but also what can and cannot do the tool on which it is built, not necessarily technical language since I don’t think you expect the customer to be familiar with it, but the point is to make him understand that using a certain type of
    tools you have limits so as to plant a seed on the fact that there will be demands that can not be developed or in the case of WixStudio, you will have to integrate code and code = higher price. This thing also combined with the idea of proposing more solutions (listing the pros and cons)
    and let the customer choose so that you can then be more protected when they make a request that goes beyond the capabilities of the tool, would help me to prevent all those cases I have seen of excessive stress and bickering with customers who treat the supplier as if they were commoners while
    the client one of the patricians (I'm not jocking, it really went like this). I don’t know much about sales but I’m pretty sure that being transparent can be an effective way not only to gain client's trust and increase the reputation of the company, but to help keep the team below sane so as to give
    everyone an extra motivation to stay in the company instead of starting looking around. Why do I think this is important? Because if you can’t explain it or not at all, the client just hears "low-code/no-code" then they will think that he can ask for anything because it will pass the message that it is very easy
    to do "so you do not write code" will think.

    From a technical point of view it depends on the tool, so it is also a bit more difficult for me to express an opinion on this point of view so I take the two that I have seen most often used as examples. Sometimes I hated Wix studio with all of myself, because yes ok cool the fact that I can manage my entire site in one place
    by using the control panel, but then I get pissed when I see the automations for example that I can’t set them exactly as I want. Then personally I find that the ease of use of Wix (questionable) is a double-edged sword, why do I say it? On the one hand this makes wix a tool accessible even to absolute beginners but I have not felt the same
    motivation that I experienced on Google Appsheet in discovering things, because on Wix most functionality has been already built for you and all you have to do is set them up based on your needs. You just have to click and you’re good, until you find the demanding clients as mentioned before. I have the feeling that the difference in using Wix
    between two or more people is seen when you write code in Wix Velo, because out of here the experience makes the difference but as in anything else. And don’t even let me start on the limits you have to make apps but since it’s a young feature I can underststand, it is not justifiable since it doesn’t even allow you to directly integrate the code, but it’s understandable.

    As for AppSheet there is already something different because apart from the views on which you have very little control from the UI point of view, you really see between those who develop who has more in one thing and who has less in another. What I love about AppSheet is that you create the features and buttons from scratch (kinda), because there’s also a database behind it.
    You can integrate code using scripts with google appscript, there is rich documentation (unlike FlowiseAI) and you can help yourself with GPTs made to assist you in developing apps in AppSheet and they are also helpful if of course you know how to write prompts.

  <p>
    As for FlowiseAI I personally hated it for similar reasons mentioned earlier like the demanding clients and the lack of control you have over what you develop. Considering that this tool is used to develop LLM applications, my personal experience with this tool in a nutshell was writing prompts and then begging it works. I felt like I had very little control over the output.
    <br>
    <br>
    In conclusion the way I see it, if you want to provide a user experience which is as complete and customizable as possible, the low-code/no-code tools should not be the whole solution but rather a support for a code development (via iframes, API calls or addresses) and not the other way around or at least that's what I think.
