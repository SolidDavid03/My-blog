  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>
    Before we start diving deeper in this topic, I think I should tell a little more about my experience with the italian educational system.<br>
    Well, besides elementary and secondary schools I attended the hotellery high school in a small town here in south Italy.
    Didactically speaking, I haven't had a bad time at school. <br>
    Until third year I had pretty good grades and from here on my grades skyrocketed, I had almost the maximum in almost every subject but I strongly believe that wasn't the result of pure skill.
    For instance my average for french went from 8/10 in third year to 10/10 in fifth year which here in Italy is the last one for high schools. However I could barely say a phrase in french, then why the hell did I have that much?
    I'll tell you then, I was the constant nice guy and yes man as all I did during classes has always been sitting at my desk all the time and not talking with anyone as I was introverted as heck and my classmates made my life a living hell.
    Not to mention that me and my elder brother (3 years older than me) went to the same high school and considering that he's always been popular as he's the complete opposite of me, automatically teachers saw in me his split image, something I could not escape from. <br>
    To get grades this high, I barely even had to try, it was more than ample for me to just memorize some information while others were instead struggling as if there was not tomorrow.
    So before I knew it, my grades not only went through the roof but they were covered in fake compliments in attempting to making me believe I was some kind of genious, but when I signed myself to university is when reality striked in harshly. <br>
    I went for a few months to university of information technology before leaving it, thinking naively that after my great performance in high school and at the final exam where which I had the maximum it would have been the same at university.
    Here was when I finally realized that everything I had lived up to that point was nothing more than a lie, school never cared about others, not even me, let alone if university would have done it. So after a few months spent in university I left. I remember how I felt at that time. I felt lost, without a purpose, but at the same time I was utterly disgusted by what I just realized.
    The educatinal system doesn't care about you nor your needs, it's just a way to model workers who think and act at the same way as everyone else. I have seen too many high school students enroll at the first university they had seen just to please their parents or simply because they didn't have a clear guiding purpose for their life decisions. <br>
    As if it wasn't enough, when I later started learning more about how efficient learning works, I couldn’t help but look back at my school history and my diploma with more disgust than before.
    And here I think why not all but most of traditional degrees are just labels which do not really define a person.
    <br>
    <br>
    The way I see it, traditional degrees such as bachelor’s and diploma are useful up to a certain point. From a learning point of view I find that getting a degree can be just an waste of time for several reasons.
    Here I list a few things that I want to talk about when it comes to the education system and and the overlasting effects on students.

<main id="maincontent_education_system">
  <h1>1. False expectations</h1>
  <img src="Images/false_expectations.jpeg" alt="Graph comparing reality and expectations" id="false_exp_img">
    <p>
      We’ve all been a little bit raised with this idea that having a degree brings you into the world of work in a guaranteed way, without a degree you will never be able to find a job of any respect. Perhaps
      this could have been true once, at least the first part of the idea. Now just looking around you a little is enough to realize that this idea is full of holes, plus at work no one cares about what path you have taken in school
      and possibly university, what matters are your skills and unfortunately the university (let alone school) doesn’t really teach you the skills you need to get into some place you want, but what happens is more likely this:
      <ul>
        <li>You "study" to pass exams and then forget everything;</li>
        <li>In most cases the practice is absent or almost;</li>
        <li>You are not really prepared for the world because the system has remained obsolete while the world out there goes on every day.</li>
      </ul>
      I put "study" in quotes because you’re not even studying, but you’re storing information so that you can vomit it out like a parrot at exams that have been called so
      to mask the fact that they are nothing more than memorizing tests that once completed, you forget everything because you know that once passed the exam you do not have to do it anymore and
      then you forget all the information related to it.
    </p>
  <h1>2. Outdated and ineffective learning system</h1>
  <img src="Images/old_classroom.avif" alt="An old classroom with students and a teacher" id="old_class_img">
    <p>
      As mentioned above, the system of learning (at least in Italy) in schools has lagged behind. It is all based on memory and those teachers who say the contrary condemn those
      who store information where there is little or nothing to understand by saying that memory is completely useless and you just have to understand. Schools do not provide the tools
      to help students learn better, because most teachers don’t even have the slightest idea of how learning actually works. Those few teachers who see through this mountain of
      misinformation and want to fix it are often misunderstood and condemned because they have different methods of operation.
    </p>
    <h2>Grades</h2>
    <img src="Images/grades.png" alt="An F grade written on a paper test" id="grades_img">
      <p>
        Grades are designed to give the student feedback on their performance, so they can see what they did well and what they can improve. The problem is how they were handled, because grades aren't really
        used as feedback but they're commonly translated into a number (or a letter). Got it? A student works his butt off to study and get ready for a question, then gets a number that is not even accompanied by constructive criticism to encourage the student to improve. As if that was not enough, grades are not even
        given in the most factual way possible. Considering they are assigned by people, as such they are subject to bias, among these the ones which intervene most in this field we find those of sympathy and antipathy. To give a clear example when I went to high school in French I was really bad and I could barely pick out a word, despite this
        I found 10 in the report card. Where do I want to go with this? This not only means that the grade is most often not based on performance itself but also that a single
        teacher has the potential to ruin students' lives by abusing his or her freedom of action, not that much is left today.
      </p>
  <h1>3. The school environment is suffocating</h1>
  <img src="Images/school_suffocating.jpeg" alt="Students inline sit at their desk" id="school_suffocating_img">
      <p>
        When a student finishes their studies they're happy, but what is one of the things that you hear them say most often? Is it "How nice, now that I have finished school I can use what I have learned to find my place in the world"?
        No? Then maybe it’s "Now that it’s over I can’t wait to continue my studies at university".
        The answer is neither of them, when a student finishes school and knows that they will no longer have to deal with it, they almost always feel happy because they believe that they must not open a book in their life,
        because this is what school does to you, it makes you associate learning something new with spitting blood on books when learning is quite different. See? This is also the reason why fewer and fewer people decide to go to university.
      </p>
  <h1>4. Bulliyng almost always prevails (and gets ignored)</h1>
  <img src="Images/bullying.jpg" alt="Kid getting laughed at by a group of other students" id="bullying_img">
      <p>
        Personally I haven't been bullied much when I was in school but when happened I felt powerless. I've already seen what happens to who
        tries to stand against bullying and things ended good once in a blue moon. Teachers don't care about it and the worst part is that if you're being bullied and
        you fairly fight back instead of getting pummelled, then YOU are the whom gets punished, not the bully. Now I know that more often than not bullies don't have an easy life and
        their methods are a way to express their weakness but I don't think that's a valid excuse to walk on others and make their life a living hell. The most common advices you hear on how to deal with bullying are something like:
        <ul>
          <li>"Ignore them"</li>
          <li>"Just laugh when they provoke you"</li>
          <li>"They're just jealous"</li>
          <li>"Be kind with them, don't push yourself to their same level"</li>
        </ul>
        Yeah, good luck being kind, laughing and ignoring them as soon as they punch you and/or mentally torture you.
